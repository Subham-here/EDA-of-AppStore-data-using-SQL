# EDA-of-AppStore-data-using-SQL
Here I have tried to explore and analyse a dataset named 'APPLE_STORE_DATA' which contained 2 datasets 
  - AppleStore.csv (Contains details about the apps, how people have rated them, in how many languages they are available, size and price of the application and so on)
  - appleStore_description.csv (contains the application name and their descriptions)

###### I have attached the datasets to the repository. You can download those directly from there.
